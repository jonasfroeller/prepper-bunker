### WebSocket Connection Test
# Note: HTTP file format doesn't fully support WebSocket connections
# Consider using other tools like wscat or a browser-based WebSocket client

# WebSocket endpoint
# ws://localhost:8069/ws/updates

# To connect using wscat:
# wscat -c ws://localhost:8069/ws/updates

# After establishing a connection, perform CRUD operations using the other HTTP files
# to see real-time notifications coming through the WebSocket
